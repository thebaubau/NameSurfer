Suppose that you want to plot two different types of data in the NameSurfer
program: baby name popularities (as you're already doing), and surname
popularities. Suppose you also have a second data file containing the
popularities of surnames in the United States over time, structured in the same
way as the baby names file. These questions ask you about the changes you would
need to make to your program in order to support this.

1. What changes would you make to the interactors in your program to support
   the two different data sets? Why? Where in the program would you make these
   changes? You don't need to give any actual code here - just describe the
   changes at a high level.
   
   
   
2. What changes would you make to your program in order to store and retrieve
   information about two different types of data? Where in the program would
   you make these changes? As before, you don't need to give us actual code
   here; high-level descriptions suffice.
   
   
   
3. What changes, if any, would you make to the NameSurferGraph to differentiate
   between baby names and surnames? As before, you don't need to give us actual
   code here; high-level descriptions suffice.
